-A (Enable OS and version detection, script scanning, and traceroute)

-T4 (faster execution)

- --resolve-all (When a hostname is given as a target, it is resolved via the Domain Name System (DNS) to determine the IP address to scan. 
If the name resolves to more than one IP address, only the first one will be scanned. Use this to make Nmap scan all the resolved addresses instead of only the first one)

- /<numbits> (append this to the end of an ip address or hostname for CIDR notation. <hostname>/24 would scan the 256 hosts between the hostname. /0 would target the 
whole internet. The largest value for IPv4 is /32, which scans just the named host or IP address because all address bits are fixed. The largest value for
IPv6 is /128, which does the same thing.)

-sL (list scan: The list scan is a degenerate form of host discovery that simply lists each host of the network(s) specified, without sending any packets to the target 
hosts. If you wish to disable host discovery while still performing such higher level functionality, read up on the -Pn (skip host discovery) option.)

-sn (no port scan. This option tells Nmap not to do a port scan after host discovery, and only print out the available hosts that responded to the host discovery probes.)

--Pn (disable host discovery/no ping. Systems administrators often find this option valuable as well. It can easily be used to count available machines on a network or 
monitor server availability. This is often called a ping sweep, and is more reliable than pinging the broadcast address because many hosts do not reply to broadcast queries.)

- For machines on a local ethernet network, ARP scanning will still be performed (unless --disable-arp-ping or --send-ip is specified) because Nmap needs MAC addresses 
to further scan target hosts.
