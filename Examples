- A representative Nmap scan: nmap -A -T4 scanme.nmap.org

- Show common Nmap options, but some obscure options are not included here (would need to read manual) : nmap

- Note: Everything on the Nmap command-line that isn't an option (or option argument) is treated as a target host specification. The simplest case is to specify 
a target IP address or hostname for scanning.

- Octet range addressing will allow you to skip IPs. For example, 192.168.0-255.1-254 will skip all addresses in the range that end in .0 or .255, and 192.168.3-5,7.1 
will scan the four addresses 192.168.3.1, 192.168.4.1, 192.168.5.1, and 192.168.7.1. Using - by itself is the same as 0-255, but remember to use 0- in the first octet 
so the target specification doesn't look like a command-line option.

- To input from a list, simply generate the list of hosts to scan and pass that filename to Nmap as an argument to the -iL option. You can specify a hyphen (-) as 
the filename if you want Nmap to read hosts from standard input rather than an actual file.: -iL <inputfilename> (Input from list)

- To randomly choose targets, the <num hosts> argument tells Nmap how many IPs to generate. Undesirable IPs such as those in certain private, multicast, or 
unallocated address ranges are automatically skipped. The argument 0 can be specified for a never-ending scan. The command (nmap -Pn -sS -p 80 -iR 0 --open) will 
locate random web servers for browsing: -iR <num hosts> (Choose random targets)

- --exclude <host1>[,<host2>[,...]] will specify a comma-separated list of targets to be excluded from the scan even if they are part of the overall network 
range you specify. This can be useful when the network you wish to scan includes untouchable mission-critical servers, systems that are known to react adversely 
to port scans, or subnets administered by other people.

--excludefile <exclude_file> (Exclude list from file) This offers the same functionality as the --exclude option, except that the excluded targets are provided 
in a newline-, space-, or tab-delimited <exclude_file> rather than on the command line.The exclude file may contain comments that start with # and extend to the 
end of the line.
